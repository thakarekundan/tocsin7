                  <p style = "text-align: justify;">Completed my UG with major in Computer Science from Govt. Holkar College, Indore M.P. Currently, Pursuing Masters in Computer Applications from NIT TRICHY.Just started crawling in the field of Data Science. But Front end designing is like going back to art school where you can express yourself. In spare time I would love to give words to my imagination by sitting  with a cup of coffee on the lap of a mountain . </p>
